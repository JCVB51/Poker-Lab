# 🎴 Poker Lab

**Poker Lab** is a lightweight web-based card simulator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It demonstrates object-oriented design and DOM manipulation by allowing users to shuffle a deck, draw cards, and visualize them interactively on screen.

## 🚀 Features

- **Shuffle Deck:** Creates a fresh deck and resets the table.
- **Draw Cards:** Click the deck image to draw a random card.
- **Interactive UI:** Card images and info render dynamically in real-time.
- **Deck State Feedback:** Deck back turns red when empty; shuffle button reactivates automatically.
- **No Dependencies:** 100% vanilla JS (no frameworks or libraries required).

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Shuffle**  
   Clicking the **SHUFFLE** button resets the deck and clears all drawn cards.

2. **Draw**  
   Clicking the **deck image** draws the top card and displays it with its suit and rank.

3. **Deck Exhausted**  
   When the deck runs out, the back image changes to red and the shuffle button reactivates.
