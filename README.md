# Poker-Lab
Poker Lab is a simple JavaScript card game simulator that demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic OOP concepts in web development. The project allows users to shuffle a virtual deck of cards, draw cards interactively, and visualize them dynamically using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
